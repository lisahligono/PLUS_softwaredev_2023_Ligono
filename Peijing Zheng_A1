Hello,
This is Peijing Zheng.
* Quotation I like: Believe in yourself first, and then others will believe you.
* A food I don't like: carrot
* A recommendation for something and why: Atomic Habit, the book introduces a lot of ways to help us establish a good habit with a little bit changes.
* One German language word I have learned: Freut mich, dich kennenzulernen. (Nice to meet you.)
