 Hi, 
 this is the file made by me, Tom Scherndl, for the sake of A1. 

 # One quotation that I like 
"Programming is not about typing. It is about thinking." -- Rich Hickey  

I thought it makes sense to put a quote here that fits to the class' topic? :) 

# Food or flavour that I don‘t like
Oysters. Had one bad experience years ago and still cannot stand them. 

# Recommendation
I really enjoy walks at the Mönchsberg - you can start at the church of Mülln and climb up. Then you can stroll along till you reach the fortress. You have a beautiful view over Salzburg (either old-town or Riedenburg, depending on which side of the round-trip you take). Cool in summer (take good friends and some beers with you) and even at Silvester. The fireworks are really great and you avoid missing out on the fireworks due to fog and low visibility created by others who shoot fireworks. 

# one German language word you have learned, or think is useful for others to know
"Oachkatzlschwoaf": Bavarian/Salzburg dialect - means "Eichkätzchenschweif" in standard German which translates to "squirrel's tail". It is mostly used by natives to check how good your (Bavarian) German is: if you can pronounce it perfectly, you will get a lot of kudos and surprise.. ;-) Just to make it clear that I am not messing with you - here is the link to Wikionary (including audio file): [Link to Wiktionary](https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Oachkatzlschwoaf)
